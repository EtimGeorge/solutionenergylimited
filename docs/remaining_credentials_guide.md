Vercel is reporting **"No entrypoint found"** for your deployment. This means it could not locate the main server file (like `index.js`, `server.js`, or one of the alternatives) anywhere in your project root or `/src` folder.

Since your project is:
- **Frontend:** Static HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Express Node.js

**Common issues and solutions:**

**For Express/Node on Vercel:**
- Your backend must have an entry file like `index.js` or `server.js` (usually at the root).
- If you use API routes, put your Express code in `/api` as `index.js` or `server.js` (Vercel prefers serverless functions).
  - Example: `/api/index.js` containing all your Express logic.

**For Static Site:**
- Static files (HTML, CSS, JS) should live in a `/public` or `/static` folder, or the root as `index.html`.

**How to fix:**
- Confirm your backend entry file (`index.js`, `server.js`, etc.) is present in the root or `/api`
- If deploying a traditional Node.js backend, consider using Vercel's serverless API system or convert Express routes to serverless functions.
- Ensure your static content can be served—for pure static sites, set the output directory appropriately (often `/public`).

**Action Steps:**
1. **Check your repo:** There must be a main entry file as Vercel expects (or, for static, set up as described).
2. **For Express:** Move code to `/api/index.js` and export the handler for serverless. Example:
   ```javascript
   // /api/index.js
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   // ... your routes
   module.exports = app;
   ```
3. **For static site:** Ensure you have `index.html` at root or `/public`.

**Summary:**  
Vercel couldn't find an entrypoint for your Node.js backend. Adjust your file/folder structure, or migrate Express routes to `/api`. Once that’s done, your deployment should proceed without the current error.[1]
