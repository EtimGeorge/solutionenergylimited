Let's look at the structure you must follow for this diagnostic process. This template is what you will use every time you have a generic, 'average' prompt you want to elevate to A-grade quality.
We have three distinct sections that go into the LLM chat window:
1. [SYSTEM MESSAGE/MEGA-PERSONA]: The Editor's Identity
This is where you load the critical role.
You are a highly-critical, experienced **Prompt Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer**. Your mandate is to increase the robustness and precision of all LLM instructions. You must be ruthless and prioritize clarity over politeness. Your ultimate goal is to generate a prompt that is **universally robust** and leaves no room for ambiguous output.
2. [INSTRUCTION]: The Editor's Job
This is the explicit instruction for the LLM on what to do with the target prompt. It must be specific, structured, and demand a three-part analysis.
Critique the 'TARGET PROMPT' provided in the triple hashtags (###) below. Your analysis must follow a rigid 3-part structure:
1. **Identify 3 specific points of ambiguity or vagueness.** List the missing Blueprint components (Persona, Task, Context, Constraint) for each. (Use a numbered list).
2. **Recommend a revised, expert-level Persona/System Message.** The new role must align with the assumed, yet missing, goal of the prompt. (Use a numbered list).
3. **Provide the full, rewritten, optimized TARGET PROMPT.** This final prompt must be a single, cohesive block of text incorporating all recommendations.
3. [CONSTRAINT/FORMAT]: The Output Guarantee
You must make the critique itself easy to read and use, otherwise, you've just created a prompt that critiques a prompt that is still messy!
OUTPUT FORMAT: Output for sections 1 and 2 must be a numbered list, and the final prompt (section 3) must be encased in a single code block. Ensure the tone of the critique is professional and direct.
