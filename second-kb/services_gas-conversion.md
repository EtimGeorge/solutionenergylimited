# Gas Conversion Solutions

## Clean Energy for Power and Transport
SEESL specializes in safe and efficient gas conversion solutions, enabling clients to utilize cleaner, more cost-effective energy sources like Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) for power generation and vehicle fleets.

## Gas Conversion Expertise

We have developed strong expertise in gas conversion technologies, having entered into mutual agreements with our team of foreign technology providers that possess well-proven, commercially viable & patented technologies in gas conversion specifically to various natural gas liquids and other intended products. These Technologies come in compact and modular units.

### Our Gas Conversion Technologies Include:

  * __Flare gas to Diesel or Gasoline
  * __Flare gas to LNG, CNG or LPG
  * __Modular gas to Power technologies
  * __Natural gas to Blue Ammonia
  * __Natural gas to Blue Hydrogen

### Auto-CNG Solutions
We provide full-scope services for converting vehicle fleets from petrol (PMS) or diesel (AGO) to dual-fuel or dedicated CNG systems.

*   **Vehicle Conversion Kits:** Installation of certified, high-quality CNG conversion kits for light-duty vehicles (cars, buses, tricycles) and heavy-duty trucks.
*   **CNG Refueling Stations:** Design, construction, and commissioning of modular or fixed CNG mother and daughter stations.
*   **Fleet Maintenance:** Specialized maintenance and support for converted CNG vehicle fleets.

### CNG Modules for Power Generation
Leveraging natural gas to provide reliable and cleaner power for industrial and commercial operations.

*   **Modular CNG Systems:** Installation of CNG fuel supply and conditioning modules for existing or new power generators (100kVA to 5MVA range).
*   **Gas Pipeline Connection:** Design and installation of gas infrastructure connecting to modular power units.
*   **Conversion to Dual-Fuel:** Retrofitting existing diesel generators to run on a mix of diesel and gas for fuel savings.

### LNG Industrial Solutions
For high-volume industrial energy needs where pipeline gas access is challenging.

*   **LNG Supply Chain:** Consultation and setup for LNG transport and storage solutions.
*   **Vaporization Units:** Installation of LNG vaporization and pressure reduction units to supply gas to industrial boilers, furnaces, and power plants.
*   **Turnkey Installation:** Full engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) for LNG-to-Power facilities.

## Combustion Engines | Dual Fuel Technology & Support Services

As part of our contribution to the actualization of the Nigerian Gas Masterplan, we have developed great capability in Autogas Technologies. We make use of Italian Standard Sequential CNG kits that are the latest in CNG Autogas technology. We install these kits in your vehicles or Power generators professionally with minimal damages and offer Bi-annual checks and certifications for your assets.

### Our Dual Fuel Services Include:

  * __ PMS and Auto-CNG for light duty vehicles including Tricycles
  * __ AGO and Auto-CNG for heavy duty vehicles
  * __ Installation of CNG Module for Modular power generation
  * __ Installation of LNG Module for Industrial Power generators
  * __ Post-Installation Support services
  * __ Sales of Quality parts and Accessories

## Economic and Environmental Benefits
*   **Significant Cost Savings:** Reduced dependence on volatile petroleum product prices.
*   **Lower Emissions:** Reduced Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), and Particulate Matter (PM) emissions.
*   **Energy Security:** Diversification of energy sources for reliable power.
