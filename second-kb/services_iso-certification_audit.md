# ISO Audit Services

## Ensuring System Effectiveness
Our qualified and impartial auditors conduct comprehensive audits to assess the effectiveness, conformance, and compliance of your management system. An audit is a critical tool for identifying vulnerabilities and driving continuous improvement, not just a precursor to certification.

### Types of Audits We Provide

#### 1. Third-Party Pre-Certification Audits
*   **Purpose:** An independent assessment to determine your organization's readiness for the formal external (Stage 1 and Stage 2) audit by a Certification Body.
*   **Benefit:** Identifies all major and minor non-conformities before the main audit, allowing for corrective action that significantly increases the chance of first-time certification success.

#### 2. Internal Audit Outsourcing (First-Party)
*   **Purpose:** Outsourcing your mandatory internal audit function to SEESL's certified auditors.
*   **Benefit:** Ensures impartiality and deeper expertise. Our auditors bring a fresh perspective and a wider view of best practices from across the industry, enhancing the quality of your audit findings.

#### 3. Supplier/Vendor Audits (Second-Party)
*   **Purpose:** Assessing the compliance and quality of your critical suppliers or contractors.
*   **Benefit:** Provides assurance that your supply chain adheres to your quality (ISO 9001) or safety (ISO 45001) requirements, mitigating supply chain risk.
