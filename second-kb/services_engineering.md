*   **HSE Reviews:** Preliminary hazard identification and risk assessment.

#### 2. Fabrication & Construction
We manage and execute all phases of fabrication and on-site construction under strict HSEQ protocols.
*   **Structural Steel Fabrication:** Pipe racks, platforms, and structural supports.
*   **Piping & Pipeline Construction:** Welding, installation, and Nondestructive Testing (NDT) services.
*   **Mechanical Installation:** Installation of static and rotating equipment (pumps, compressors, vessels).
*   **Civil Works Integration:** Foundations, access roads, and control room buildings.

#### 3. Installation & Commissioning
Our certified engineers ensure the seamless transition from construction to operation.
*   **Pre-Commissioning Checks:** System flushing, pressure testing, and loop checks.
*   **Hot Commissioning:** Introduction of process fluids and running the system up to operating parameters.
*   **Performance Testing:** Verifying the installed plant meets all design specifications and performance guarantees.

#### 4. Process Engineering Solutions
*   **Process Optimization:** Identifying bottlenecks and implementing modifications to improve yield and reduce energy consumption.
*   **Debottlenecking Studies:** Analyzing existing systems to maximize throughput.
*   **Technical Documentation:** Generation and updating of all engineering documentation and technical manuals.

### Industry Focus
*   **Oil & Gas:** Separation packages, flowline construction, storage terminal modifications.
*   **Power & Energy:** Installation of generating sets, balance of plant (BoP) for power stations, and solar field integration.
*   **Industrial:** Utility installation (air, water, steam), and specialized equipment skids.
