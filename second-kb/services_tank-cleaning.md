# Tank & Vessel Cleaning

## Automated Safety and Efficiency
We utilize cutting-edge automated robotic systems for the cleaning of petroleum storage tanks, pressure vessels, and industrial water tanks, significantly reducing human entry and risk while delivering superior cleaning quality.

### Automated Tank Cleaning (ATC)
Our proprietary and partner-based Automated Tank Cleaning systems eliminate the need for man entry in the most hazardous and confined spaces, dramatically improving HSEQ performance and operational efficiency.

*   **Crude Oil and Product Storage Tanks (Onshore/Offshore):** Safe removal and recovery of sludge, ensuring maximum product recovery and tank readiness for inspection or change of service.
*   **Benefits of Automation:**
    *   **Maximized Safety:** Zero man-entry into a hazardous environment.
    *   **Reduced Emissions:** Contained process minimizes hydrocarbon vapor release.
    *   **Speed & Efficiency:** Significant reduction in downtime compared to manual methods.
    *   **Product Recovery:** Maximizing the recovery of valuable hydrocarbons from the sludge.

### Pressure Vessel Cleaning
Specialized cleaning of high-pressure vessels, separators, and process equipment.

*   **Chemical and Mechanical Cleaning:** Tailored cleaning methodologies based on the vessel's prior service and contamination type.
*   **Confined Space Entry Protocol:** Where manual entry is unavoidable, we implement strict, certified confined space entry, rescue, and gas monitoring procedures.

### Water Storage Tanks Cleaning
*   **Potable Water Tanks:** Hygienic cleaning and disinfection of water storage facilities to prevent microbial contamination.
*   **Industrial Water Systems:** Cleaning of fire water tanks and process water storage.

### Waste Management & Sludge Treatment
As part of our commitment to ISO 14001, we ensure responsible handling of all recovered waste.
*   **Sludge Dewatering:** Processing recovered sludge to separate hydrocarbons, water, and solids.
*   **Certified Disposal:** Transportation and disposal of final waste streams in compliance with all environmental regulations.
